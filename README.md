>üí° **Test the App Online**  
You can try out OctaProbe directly in your browser by visiting [OctaProbe](https://octaprobe.streamlit.app/).
Note: Limited functionality on the testing version!

<br><br>

## ‚ùì What is it?

OctaProbe is a lightweight and efficient vulnerability scanner designed to identify security weaknesses in various systems. Built with Python and leveraging modern frameworks like Streamlit, it provides an intuitive interface for users to perform scans and analyze results. OctaProbe supports multiple operating systems, making it a versatile tool for developers, security analysts, and IT professionals.

## üöÄ How to Install?

> Before proceeding, ensure you have a basic understanding of the command line and that Git is installed on your system. If Git is not installed, follow the [official Git installation guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).  (Not to be confused with GitHub Desktop!)

> üí° **Need a tailored guide?**  
> Refer to the [Project Wiki](https://github.com/NONAN23x/Octaprobe/wiki) for detailed, platform-specific instructions.

<br>

1. Install `uv` package manager:
    
    - Windows:
        ```powershell
        powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
        ```
    - Linux:
        ```bash
        wget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
        ```

<br>

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Restart your terminal emulator so that uv is reflected on your PATH

<br>

2. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NONAN23x/Octaprobe.git
    ```
3. Navigate inside the repository and run uv to sync dependencies (Only if this is your first time running this app!):
    ```bash
    cd Octaprobe
    ```
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```
    Uv Sync is just gonna take 1-2 minutes on average, so please be patient
    
    <br>

    -  (Optional) Run setup.py with uv to initialize local llm:
        ```bash
        uv run setup.py
        ```
        > ‚ö†Ô∏è The script ensures that all required libraries are installed and that the Ollama service is properly set up. The setup script will automatically check for Ollama's installation and configuration. If Ollama is not installed or configured, the script will redirect you to the [Ollama Documentation](https://ollama.com/) for guidance. Please ensure the service is active and accessible to avoid any runtime issues.

        > ‚ö†Ô∏è The setup.py ensures that you have Virustotal API key installed and accessible, if not found; setup redirects you to webpage where you can sign up using google chrome and get your API key, you can have to add this to your OS Environment Variable

        - For Windows
        Go to Search Bar > Environment Variables > Add new variable `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY`
        - For Linux
        Open up a terminal, add the following to your .bashrc or .zshrc
            ```bash 
            export VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY="Your API Key Here"
            ```

<br>

3. Run the application:  
    ```bash
    uv run streamlit run app.py
    ```
    - When running this for the first time, streamlit asks for your email, if you don't wish to provide it, simply leave it blank and hit enter :)
